# CDS

This project includes both a desktop application and a terminal/console version for generating and recording prescriptions based on the patient's age, pregnancy status, allergy status, and weight. The desktop app is built using the tkinter library in Python, while the terminal/console version is a text-based interface.

==Owing to the limitation of time, the destrop version has some bugs which are still not solved :|==

## Features

- Easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) for the desktop app
- Text-based terminal/console interface for those who prefer command-line interaction
- Generate prescription based on user's input
- Save prescription records to a CSV file
- Display previous prescriptions from the CSV file
- Logging functionality for debugging and development purposes
